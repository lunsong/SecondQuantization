# Second Quantization in Lean4

This project is a formalization of the method of [second quantization](https://lean-lang.org/) in [Lean4](https://lean-lang.org/). The documentation is at [here](http://8.148.4.14/lean/SecondQuantization/Basic.html)

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim of the project

The primary goal of this project is to build a rigorous, formalized mathematical framework for second quantization. This will serve as a foundational library for researchers at the intersection of artificial intelligence, theoretical chemistry, and condensed matter physics. By providing a trustworthy and verifiable codebase, we hope to enable new avenues of research and discovery, particularly in the application of AI to complex quantum systems.

## ðŸš© TODOs

- [x] creation and annihilation operators and their basic properties
- [x] vacuum expectation and its properties
- [ ] Hatree-Fock method
