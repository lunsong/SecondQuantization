# SecondQuantization

The operators are defined as the free algebra generated by creation and annihilation operators
quotient by the commutation rules. Currently restricted to ℝ-algebra, since ℂ is not necessary
from a physical perspective, and use discrete indices to avoid the Dirac-delta function.

The Fock space, which represent the physical state, is defined as the operators quotient by the
annihilating operators, which are the operators that start with an annihilation operator.

The expectation value can be obtained by first taking the quotient with respect to the 
annihilating operators and its conjugate, which are operators that end with a creation operator,
then using the theorem that the quotient space has dimension one to extract a real valued
expectation.

## Definitions

* `Fock.Operator` is the type of creation and annihilation operators
* `Fock.cre` and `Fock.ann` are the creation and annihilation operators
* `Fock` represent the Fock space
* `vacuum_expectation_eq_real` can be used to extract vacuum expectation value
